ðŸ”§ 1. STRUCTURE REFACTOR PLAN
Hereâ€™s how weâ€™ll break up the function into reusable, clean components:

Component	Extracted asâ€¦	Reason
Screen clearing	clear_screen() (âœ… done)	Already modular
User input + validation	get_valid_guess(length, min, max)	Reusable and makes the main loop cleaner
Evaluation of guess	evaluate_guess(code, guess)	Makes feedback logic clean
Feedback message	generate_feedback_string(correct_number, correct_location, feedback_mode)	Prepares for difficulty-based feedback
Difficulty setup (future)	load_difficulty(mode)	Makes game logic configurable

ðŸ§  What This Will Achieve
Your main loop becomes a narrative, not a wall of logic

You can plug in different difficulty modes easily

Makes debugging and testing each part simpler

Sets you up for API porting later (clean backend logic separation)

ðŸ§ª Step 1: Extract evaluate_guess(code, guess) Logic
This is the most immediate win. Hereâ€™s your current logic:

python
Copy
Edit
correct_number = 0
correct_location = 0

for i in range(4):
    if code[i] == user_guess[i]:
        correct_location += 1

copy_code = code[:]
for num in user_guess:
    if num in copy_code:
        correct_number += 1
        copy_code.remove(num)
Letâ€™s modularize it:

python
Copy
Edit
def evaluate_guess(code, guess):
    correct_location = sum(c == g for c, g in zip(code, guess))
    
    code_copy = code[:]
    correct_number = 0
    for num in guess:
        if num in code_copy:
            correct_number += 1
            code_copy.remove(num)

    return correct_number, correct_location
âœ… Same behavior
âœ… Cleaner
âœ… Easier to test and reuse
